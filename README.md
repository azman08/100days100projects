# 100 Days 100 Projects

Welcome to my **100 Days 100 Projects** challenge repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of building **100 projects** in **100 days** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to sharpen my skills, experiment with creative ideas, and consistently work on new projects every day.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or even fork the repository to start your own challenge!

## About the Challenge

The **100 Days 100 Projects** challenge is a self-imposed commitment to create small to medium-sized projects daily. Each project will focus on different aspects of web development, including:

- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid, animations, etc.)
- JavaScript functionality (DOM manipulation, API usage, event handling, etc.)

By the end of this journey, I hope to have a diverse portfolio of web projects that demonstrate various skills and techniques.
## How to Run the Projects

Each project has its own folder. To run any of the projects:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100days100projects.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```bash
   cd day-01-project-name
   ```
   
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   - For example, if you're using VS Code, right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** (if you have the Live Server extension installed).

## Project Structure

Each project follows a simple structure:

```
project-folder/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html    # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css     # CSS file for styling (optional)
â””â”€â”€ script.js     # JavaScript file for functionality (optional)
```

- The **HTML** file contains the structure and content.
- The **CSS** file defines the layout and design.
- The **JavaScript** file manages the interactivity and logic.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the projects (using Flexbox, Grid, and animations).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To add interactivity and dynamic functionality.

- **VS Code**: My code editor of choice.
- **Live Server**: For easy local development.
- **Git**: To track changes and manage project versions.
- **GitHub**: To share my progress with the world.
